\details{
Consider a system (or a component) \eqn{S_{ystem}} whose possible
states during its evolution in time are \eqn{E = \{1,\dots,s\}}.

We are interested in investigating the mean recurrence times of a
discrete-time semi-Markov system \eqn{S_{ystem}}. Consequently, we suppose
that the evolution in time of the system is governed by an E-state space
semi-Markov chain \eqn{(Z_k)_{k \in N}}. The state of the system is given
at each instant \eqn{k \in N} by \eqn{Z_k}: the event \eqn{\{Z_k = i\}}.

Let \eqn{S = (S_{n})_{n \in N}} denote the successive time points when
state changes in \eqn{(Z_{n})_{n \in N}} occur and let also
\eqn{J = (J_{n})_{n \in N}} denote the successively visited states at
these time points.

The mean recurrence of an arbitrary state \eqn{j \in E} is given by:

\deqn{\mu_{jj} = \frac{\sum_{i \in E} \nu(i) m_{i}}{\nu(j)}}

where \eqn{m_{i}} is the mean sojourn time in state \eqn{i \in E}
(see \link{meanSojournTimes} function for the computation).
