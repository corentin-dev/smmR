Description: Performs parametric and non-parametric estimation and simulation 
    for multi-state discrete-time semi-Markov processes. For the parametric 
    estimation, several discrete distributions are considered for the sojourn 
    times: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and Negative Binomial.
    The non-parametric estimation concerns the sojourn time distributions, 
    where no assumptions are done on the shape of distributions. Moreover, the 
    estimation can be done on the basis of one or several sample paths, with or
    without censoring at the beginning or/and at the end of the sample paths. 
    Reliability indicators such as reliability, maintainability, availability, 
    BMP-failure rate, RG-failure rate, mean time to failure and mean time to 
    repair are available as well. The implemented methods are described in

    Trevezas, S., Limnios, N. (2011) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2011.555543>.
    Estimation and simulation of discrete-time k-th order Markov chains are 
    also considered.
