The sojourn times are seen to be independent not identically distributed random variables and assumed to belong to a general class of distributions that includes several popular reliability distributions like the exponential, Weibull, and Pareto. We obtain maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of interest and investigate their asymptotic properties. Plug-in type estimators are furnished for various quantities related to the system under study.},

  abstract = {International organizations evaluate credit risk and rank firms according to risk by assigning them a `rating'. The time evolution of a rating can be studied by means of Markov models. Some papers have outlined the problem pertaining to the unsuitable fitting of Markov processes in a credit risk environment. This paper presents a model that overcomes the problems given by the Markov rating models. It includes non-homogeneity, the downward problem and the randomness of time in the transitions of states, thus making it possible to consider the duration inside a state in a complete way. In this paper, both, the transient and asymptotic analyses are presented. The asymptotic analysis is performed by using a mono-unireducible topological structure. Moreover, a real data application is conducted using the historical database of Standard {\&} Poor's as the source.},

  abstract = {The present paper aims at the introduction of the semi-Markov model in continuous time as a candidate model for the description of seismicity patterns in time domain in the Northern Aegean Sea (Greece). Estimators of the semi-Markov kernels, Markov renewal functions and transition functions are calculated through a nonparametric method. Moreover, the hitting times for spatial occurrence of the strongest earthquakes as well as the confidence intervals of certain important indicators are estimated. Firstly, the classification of model states is based on earthquakes magnitude. The instantaneous earthquake occurrence rate between the states of the model as well as the total earthquake occurrence rate are calculated. In order to increase the consistency between the model and the process of earthquake generation, seismotectonic features have been incorporated as an important component in the model. Therefore, a new classification of states is proposed which combines both magnitude and fault orientation states. This model which takes into account seismotectonic features contributes significantly to the seismic hazard assessment in the region under study. The model is applied to earthquake catalogues for the Northern Aegean Sea, an area that accommodates high seismicity, being a key structure from the seismotectonic point of view.},
