#' BMP-Failure Rate Function
#' 
#' @description Consider a system \eqn{S_{ystem}} starting to work at time 
#'   \eqn{k = 0}. The BMP-failure rate at time \eqn{k \in N} is the conditional 
#'   probability that the failure of the system occurs at time \eqn{k}, given 
#'   that the system has worked until time \eqn{k - 1}.
#' 
#' @details Consider a system (or a component) \eqn{S_{ystem}} whose possible 
#'   states during its evolution in time are \eqn{E = \{1,\dots,s\}}. 
#'   Denote by \eqn{U = \{1,\dots,s_1\}} the subset of operational states of 
#'   the system (the up states) and by \eqn{D = \{s_1 + 1,\dots,s\}} the 
#'   subset of failure states (the down states), with \eqn{0 < s_1 < s} 
#'   (obviously, \eqn{E = U \cup D} and \eqn{U \cap D = \emptyset}, 
#'   \eqn{U \neq \emptyset,\ D \neq \emptyset}). One can think of the states 
#'   of \eqn{U} as different operating modes or performance levels of the 
#'   system, whereas the states of \eqn{D} can be seen as failures of the 
#'   systems with different modes.
#'   
#'   We are interested in investigating the failure rate of a discrete-time 
#'   semi-Markov system \eqn{S_{ystem}}. Consequently, we suppose that the 
#'   evolution in time of the system is governed by an E-state space 
#'   semi-Markov chain \eqn{(Z_k)_{k \in N}}. The system starts to work at 
#'   instant \eqn{0} and the state of the system is given at each instant 
#'   \eqn{k \in N} by \eqn{Z_k}: the event \eqn{\{Z_k = i\}}, for a certain 
#'   \eqn{i \in U}, means that the system \eqn{S_{ystem}} is in operating mode 
#'   \eqn{i} at time \eqn{k}, whereas \eqn{\{Z_k = j\}}, for a certain 
#'   \eqn{j \in D}, means that the system is not operational at time \eqn{k} 
#'   due to the mode of failure \eqn{j} or that the system is under the 
#'   repairing mode \eqn{j}.
#'   
#'   The BMP-failure rate at time \eqn{k \in N} is the conditional probability 
#'   that the failure of the system occurs at time \eqn{k}, given that the 
#'   system has worked until time \eqn{k - 1}.
#'   
#'   Let \eqn{T_D} denote the first passage time in subset \eqn{D}, called 
#'   the lifetime of the system, i.e.,
#'   
#'   \deqn{T_D := \textrm{inf}\{ n \in N;\ Z_n \in D\}\ \textrm{and}\ \textrm{inf}\ \emptyset := \infty.}
#'   
#'   For a discrete-time semi-Markov system, the failure rate at time 
#'   \eqn{k \geq 1} has the expression:
#'   
#'   \deqn{\lambda(k) := P(T_{D} = k | T_{D} \geq k)}
#'   
#'   We can rewrite it as follows :
#'   
#'   \deqn{\lambda(k) = 1 - \frac{R(k)}{R(k - 1)},\ \textrm{if } R(k - 1) \neq 0;\ \lambda(k) = 0, \textrm{otherwise}}
#'   
#'   The failure rate at time \eqn{k = 0} is defined by \eqn{\lambda(0) := 1 - R(0)},
#'   with \eqn{R} being the reliability function (see [reliability] function).
#'   
#'   The calculation of the reliability \eqn{R} involves the computation of 
#'   many convolutions. It implies that the computation error, may be higher 
#'   (in value) than the "true" reliability itself for reliability close to 0.
#'   In order to avoid inconsistent values of the BMP-failure rate, we use the 
#'   following formula:
#'   
#'   \deqn{\lambda(k) = 1 - \frac{R(k)}{R(k - 1)},\ \textrm{if } R(k - 1) \geq \epsilon;\ \lambda(k) = 0, \textrm{otherwise}}
#'
